A modified brain tumore segmentation model based on 'Extending nn-UNet forÂ Brain Tumor Segmentation' for Brats-Africa challenge
* The major modification is on Data augmentation, In addition to the previous augmentation techniques we have added a custom image sharpenning step, unsharp masking. (training.data_augmentation.unsharp_masking_lucy)
As stated on the paper "The Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) Challenge 2023: Glioma Segmentation in Sub-Saharan Africa Patient Population (BraTS-Africa)", one of the challenges of this dataset is the quality due to the instruments used to capture the images.


This model is under-developement.
